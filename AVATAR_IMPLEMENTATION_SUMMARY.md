## 🚀 Next Steps - Required Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_url TEXT;
```

Or use the migration file provided:
- File: `supabase_migration_add_avatar.sql`

### Step 2: Create Supabase Storage Bucket

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Click "Create a new bucket"
3. Name it: **`chat-avatars`**
4. Make it **Public** (check the public option)
5. Click "Create bucket"

### Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies

In Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Policies, create these policies for the `chat-avatars` bucket:

**For `storage.objects` table:**

1. **INSERT Policy** (Allow users to upload):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'chat-avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

2. **UPDATE Policy** (Allow users to update their own):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'chat-avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'chat-avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

3. **DELETE Policy** (Allow users to delete their own):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'chat-avatars' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

4. **SELECT Policy** (Allow everyone to view):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Avatars are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'chat-avatars');
```

### Step 4: Mobile Platform Permissions

#### iOS (ios/Runner/Info.plist)
Add before the closing `</dict>` tag:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to set AI chat avatars</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take photos for AI chat avatars</string>
```

#### Android (android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)
Add inside the `<manifest>` tag (before `<application>`):

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```

### Step 5: Test the Feature

1. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

2. Create a new chat:
   - Tap "New AI Chat"
   - Tap on the avatar circle
   - Select an image from your gallery
   - Complete the form and create

3. Edit existing chat:
   - Long-press on a chat
   - Tap on the avatar to change it
   - Select a new image

## 🎨 How It Works

### File Storage Structure
```
Supabase Storage: chat-avatars/
  └── {userId}/
      ├── {chatId1}.jpg
      ├── {chatId2}.png
      └── {chatId3}.jpg
```

### Image Optimization
- Images are automatically resized to 512x512 pixels
- Quality set to 85% for optimal balance
- Original format preserved

### Avatar Display
- Custom avatars shown in circular frame
- Falls back to robot icon if:
  - No avatar uploaded
  - Image fails to load
  - Network error
